```bash
cp packages/foundry/.env.example packages/foundry/.env
```

5. Add your environment variables in both `.env` files:

## Network Configuration

This project is configured to work with:

- Ethereum Mainnet
- Sepolia Testnet

The hardhat local network has been removed from the configuration. 

### Environment Variables

In your `packages/nextjs/.env.local` file, add the following:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_ALCHEMY_API_KEY=your_alchemy_api_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLET_CONNECT_PROJECT_ID=your_wallet_connect_project_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_ETHEREUM_RPC_URL=your_ethereum_mainnet_rpc_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=your_sepolia_testnet_rpc_url
```

In your `packages/foundry/.env` file, add:

```
DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key
SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=your_sepolia_testnet_rpc_url
